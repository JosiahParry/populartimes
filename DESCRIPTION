Description: populartimes provides an interface for accessing the popular times data provided from Google Maps. This package is a translation of the phenomenal python library of the same name. Popular times data is not supported by any official Google API. As such, it uses a combination of the Google Places API and web scraping. This is not currently supported by Google and is legally questionable. Please see issue # 90 (https://github.com/m-wrzr/populartimes/issues/90).
